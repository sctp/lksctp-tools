1.0 Introduction

Use the Linux kernel coding style as the base,
linux/Documentation/CodingStyle.

This is intended as the IETF kernel reference code for RFC2960 and the
SCTP API.  As such, readability is paramount.  We attempt to follow
the names from RFC2960 as closely as practical given the constrains of
C and the Linux kernel naming conventions.

Here are the approximate naming rules we use.  Those marked
[obsolescent] will go away once we purge the last vestiges of them.

1) [obsolescent] If a name appears in RFC 2960 or the API draft we try
   to use it as closely as permitted by C syntax without ADDING "_".
   This usually means names of the form "xyzAbc".  E.g. "Duplicate TSN"
   from RFC2960 became "DuplicateTSN", but "a_rwnd" is unaltered.

New names should use this revised rule 1:

   If a name appears in RFC 2960 or the API draft we try to use it as
   closely as permitted by C syntax without using upper case letters.
   This usually means names of the form "xyz_abc".  E.g. "Duplicate
   TSN" from RFC2960 became "duplicate_tsn", but "a_rwnd" is
   unaltered.  Remember the acronyms still need to be upper case in
   comments.

2) [obsolescent] If a name refers to a struct which appears on the wire we use
the form "struct xyzAbc".  This is historically because we inherited most
of these from the user space implementation.  E.g. "struct sctpHeader".

3) There is no rule 3.

4) All functions start with "sctp_".  Uh, yeah, well, uh...

5) Constants have the form "XYZ_ABC" per K&R.

6) [obsolecent] If "XYZ" is an acronym it SHOULD be capitalized as in
   "XYZ_abc" or "XYZabc" unless overridden by rule 2 or rule 4. E.g.
   "struct SCTP_association".

New names should use this revised rule 6:

   Names with anronyms SHOULD map them to lower case, E.g.
   "struct sctp_association".

7) All remaining names SHOULD use the form "xyz_abc".  E.g. "int too_big".

8) Deviations from these rules are bugs and need to be fixed.


2.0 Architectural and Procedural Standards

The core metaphors are the state machine (sctp_do_sm(), related
functions) and the smart pipe (inqueue, outqueue, ULPqueue, packet).

The state machine breaks down into a pure functional core,
sctp_sm_statefuns.c, with no side effects, and an explicit set of side
effects, sctp_sm_sideeffects.c.  

Every function, typedef, enum, and struct needs a descriptive comment.

3.0 /* Comments */

Except as noted below, make all comments full sentences.

Proper behaviour is to spell-cheque your comments.  Those colourful
American spellings will not be rejected.

Start all sentences with a capital letter.  Do not begin sentences
with symbols which must be all lower case.  Sentences end with a
period, question mark, or exclamation point.  Punctuation at the end
of a sentence has two trailing spaces or a trailing newline.

Comments should confine themselves to expressing the INTENT of the code.

If comments do not agree with the code, then we have a BUG.

Passive voice should be avoided.

Every function, typedef, enum, and struct needs a descriptive
comment.

/* All comments are C comments, */ 
// not C++ comments.

/* Multiline comments should
 * look like this.
 */

Every #endif should include a comment describing the matching #if.
E.g.

#if 0
#endif /* 0 */

A struct sk_buff_head needs a comment describing the REAL type of its
elements.

To disable a section of code use
#if 0
#endif /* 0 */
rather than /* */.  The if/endif pair safely interoperates with
existing comments.

4.0 Appearance & Pretty printing

Put a space after every keyword.

Here is an example function:

retval_t my_fun(int foo, struct SCTP_struct *bar)
{
	statement;
}

Every switch statement should have a default clause.  If the default
can never happen, default should crash or otherwise report failure.

A loop with no body looks like this:

        while (test()) {
	      /* Do nothing. */
	}

If a compound condition or arithemetic expression extends beyond the
79 character limit, put the operators at the end of the line.  E.g.

	if ((NULL == map->tsn_map) ||
	    (NULL == map->overflow_map) ||
	    (map->len == 0)) {
...


The if/else style must follow that of K&R style, for example:

	if (foo) {
...
	} else {
...
	}	   

Unrequired whitespace should be removed from the end of lines and end of
file.   Hardtabs should be used where possible.  


5.0 Compiler and Behavior issues

When comparing a constant to a variable, put the constant on the
left.  The compiler will tell you if you ommited a '='.  E.g.

	if (MY_CONSTANT == var) {
        	whatever();
	}

Please eliminate all compiler warnings.  "Compilation errors are, in a
way, unit test failures of their own.  They tell us that the
implementation does not match the specification." -- check.sf.net tutorial

Please make forward declarations for all functions in the appropriate
header files.  This helps us detect interface changes.

Whenever practical, allocate a large block of memory OUTSIDE a loop
and then populate it inside the loop, rather than allocating many
small blocks inside the loop.

Do not use #ifdef TEST_FRAME unless absolutely necessary.  In
particular, if you simply call kernel functions which are not defined
in the test frame, please add them to the test frame.  The only case
we know of which is difficult to handle is static inline functions.

We require using this style of initialization:

struct in_ifaddr eth2_ifa =
      {.ifa_next = NULL, .ifa_dev =  NULL, .ifa_local = 0, .ifa_address = 0};

Keyword initializations are less susceptible to bugs due to changes in
the underlying structures.


6.0 Version changes

The lksctp-tools  packages uses the "M.m.p" versioning  model for both
the package itself & the provided shared libraries:

- (M)-ajor revision change means  both source & binary incompatibility
  (user source code change might be required)

- (m)-inor revision change means source compatibility, while ABI might
  not be preserved (rebuild is required)

- (p)-atchlevel change means that both API & ABI are preserved.
